     * Saving an existing database into a backup file before overwriting     
       had been controlled by the Makefile definition DOBACKUPS.  This is    
       removed now and replaced by the options backup/!backup which can      
       be set in .scrc     
     * By definition command 'W' writes the database into a file as it       
       appears on the screen.  This did not work for double quotes (") or    
       escaped double quotes (\").  Here the required escape characters      
       itself (\) had been displayed.  But sc does remove 1 or 2 '\'         
       before a '"' when drawing on the screen.
